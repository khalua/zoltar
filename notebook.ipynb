These cities are not just places on a map but pivotal environments that have shaped my approach to user experience and product design. Here's a brief overview of the cities where I've honed my skills and left a mark through my work:\\n\\n- **San Francisco, CA**: My journey with Fjord Design at Accenture Song in San Francisco stands out as a key chapter in my career. It's here that I delved deep into human-centered methodologies across all stages of product development. The diversity of clients I worked with — from Microsoft to Sunrun and Verizon — challenged me to push the boundaries of UX/UI design, leveraging my skills to lead both remote and onsite teams to create world-class digital experiences.\\n\\n- **New York, NY**: My tenure with Liquidnet Holdings, Inc., in New York, NY, was another defining period in my professional journey. Here, I transitioned from leading an eight-person Scrum team in creating comprehensive monitoring systems to spearheading complex data center migrations. New York's fast-paced environment honed my agile management skills and my ability to adapt and deliver under pressure.\\n\\n- **London, UK**: The opportunity to relocate to London and lead the Production Support department for Liquidnet Europe Limited's European launch was a milestone in my career. This role expanded my global perspective, allowing me to manage international product launches and navigate the challenges of ensuring seamless operations across borders.\\n\\nEach of these cities has provided me with a canvas to apply my passion for human-centered design, leadership in digital commerce solutions, and my expertise in managing dynamic teams across challenging projects. Working in these urban hubs has not only broadened my network but also deepened my understanding of the global digital landscape, equipping me with the versatility and multicultural insight crucial for leading design initiatives at a global scale.\"), type='text')], created_at=1709359506, file_ids=[], metadata={}, object='thread.message', role='assistant', run_id='run_i6MuStUMRcV7Cv19N3IhKHHM', thread_id='thread_iFF972hroQfucIkscfWhWx7n'), ThreadMessage(id='msg_o8pjRzjK8tvqDtfnuDCkHtkF', assistant_id=None, content=[MessageContentText(text=Text(annotations=[], value='what cities have you worked in??'), type='text')], created_at=1709359495, file_ids=[], metadata={}, object='thread.message', role='user', run_id=None, thread_id='thread_iFF972hroQfucIkscfWhWx7n')], object='list', first_id='msg_Cb0Vz4DHwXcoVHAhNnDK1YGN', last_id='msg_o8pjRzjK8tvqDtfnuDCkHtkF', has_more=False)\n"
