# Zoltar the Magnificent

This is playground experiment using OpenAI to answer questions and my goofy face to give it some personality. It's hooked up to Open AI's Assistant API so it knows all about me which is kind of amazing. If you are a recruiter or a hiring manager, you can ask me about me.


### notes for myself
On new systems, set up venv by going to newly cloned directories and typing 'virtualenv venv' or 'python3 -m venv venv'

each time, to start type:
source venv/bin/activate
python3 app.py


To run on all interfaces for external dev: flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port8000
