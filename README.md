# Zoltar the Magnificent

This is playground experiment using OpenAI to answer questions and my goofy face to give it some personality. Will eventually be hooked up to the assistant api to be more interactive, know more about Tony, and create threads of conversation.



### notes for myself
On new systems, set up venv by going to newly cloned directories and typing 'virtualenv venv' or 'python3 -m venv venv'

each time, to start type:
source venv/bin/activate
python3 app.py


To run on all interfaces for external dev: flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port8000
